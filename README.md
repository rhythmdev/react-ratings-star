### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It

#### Just for Display

Need to show a static, non-interactive rating? Just pass a `value` and the `readOnly` prop. It's that easy.

```jsx
import Rating from "react-ratings-star";

<Rating value={4.2} readOnly={true} />;
```

#### Making it Clickable

To capture user input, manage the rating in your component's state and pass your update function to the `onRatingChange` prop.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Rating from "react-ratings-star";

function MyReview() {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Rate this product:</h3>
      <Rating
        value={rating}
        onRatingChange={setRating}
        size={32}
        fullColor="teal"
      />
      <p>Your rating is: {rating}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Adding Tooltips

Guide your users by providing descriptive tooltips. Just pass an array of strings. The component will automatically show the right text for each rating tier.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Rating from "react-ratings-star";

function TooltipRating() {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(2.5);

  // A description for each star tier
  const tooltips = ["Terrible", "Poor", "Average", "Good", "Excellent"];

  return (
    <Rating value={rating} onRatingChange={setRating} tooltips={tooltips} />
  );
}
```

#### Going Beyond Stars (Custom Icons)

Want to rate with hearts, circles, or something else entirely? No problem. Pass any React component to the `customIcon` prop. It works seamlessly with popular libraries like `react-icons`.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Rating from "react-ratings-star";
import { FaHeart } from "react-icons/fa";

function HeartRating() {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(3.5);

  return (
    <Rating
      value={rating}
      onRatingChange={setRating}
      customIcon={FaHeart}
      fullColor="#E02424"
      emptyColor="#D1D5DB"
    />
  );
}
```

### ‚ôø Built for Everyone (Accessibility)

Accessibility is a core feature, not an afterthought. The component follows the WAI-ARIA `slider` pattern for an intuitive experience for all users.

#### Keyboard Navigation

When the component is focused, users can rate with their keyboard:

| Key                   | Function               |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Right / Up Arrow**  | Increase rating by 0.5 |
| **Left / Down Arrow** | Decrease rating by 0.5 |
| **Page Up**           | Increase rating by 1   |
| **Page Down**         | Decrease rating by 1   |
| **Home**              | Set rating to 0        |
| **End**               | Set rating to `max`    |
